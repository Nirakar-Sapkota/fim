Thanks for downloading.
A proof of concept of Integrity in CIA triad by using FIM(File Integrity Monitor) to monitor the files. You can use this code as your own without restrictions. Still work in progress :) └d¥dß.
What does it do?
  1. Helps analyst create a baseline file in the directory of choice.
  2. Creates a SHA-512 encyption that is stored in the baseline for matching the integrity.
  3. User can use the exising key value pairs in baseline file.
  4. User can create a new baseline file to start monitoring the files.
  5. Outputs an alert message.
  6. Note: if you don't have a baseline file please run Option A and restart the application to run option B for continuous monitoring.
  7. This is just a proof of concept.
Thanks.
Source code will be provided soon...
